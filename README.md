| Type                       | Description                                                                                                                          | Pros                                                                               | Cons                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Package by Layer**       | Organizes code by technical role (e.g., `ui`, `domain`, `data`) inside one module                                                    | Simple to start; common in tutorials                                               | Becomes messy as app grows; tight coupling across layers         |
| **Package by Feature**     | Each feature is a module containing its own `ui`, `domain`, `data` layers                                                            | Feature isolation; great scalability for large teams                               | Duplication of cross-cutting concerns; overkill for smaller apps |
| **Package by Component** ‚úÖ | Modules are organized by *logical components* (e.g., `citysearch-ui`, `citysearch-domain`, `core-ui`) rather than features or layers | Clear separation of responsibilities; better reuse; easier testing and maintenance | Requires thoughtful architecture up front                        |

In this project:

feature:choose handles only UI logic and interacts with state from the domain

component:city-domain encapsulates use cases and business rules

component:city-data manages JSON parsing and repository implementations

Shared UI or core utilities can go into reusable modules like core-ui


## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Clean Architecture (Domain-Driven Design)

* Adopted **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** instead of Google's recommended architecture.
* **Domain layer** is **independent** and doesn‚Äôt depend on data or UI.
* Clear separation between:

  * **UI** (Compose, state management)
  * **Domain** (UseCases, Models)
  * **Data** (Repositories, JSON parsing)

### Presentation Design Patterns:

* **MVVM**: with a single `UiState` class for reactive state management
* **Repository Pattern**: abstracts data source from domain logic

üîç Search Algorithm
To meet the requirement of filtering cities by prefix in better than linear time, several approaches were evaluated and benchmarked.

‚öñÔ∏è Comparison of Search Strategies
| Approach                          | Time Complexity | Memory Usage | Maintains Order | Supports Prefix Search | Notes                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Binary Search (Sorted List)** ‚úÖ | `O(log n)`      | Low          | ‚úÖ               | ‚úÖ                      | Chosen approach; most balanced                           |
| Unsorted `HashMap`                | `O(1)` (lookup) | Medium       | ‚ùå               | ‚ùå (not prefix-capable) | Fast lookup but not suitable for prefix filtering        |
| Tree-backed `SortedMap`           | `O(log n)`      | High         | ‚úÖ               | ‚úÖ                      | Valid but uses more memory and unnecessary for this case |

‚úÖ Chosen Approach: Binary Search on Sorted List
Cities are pre-sorted alphabetically at load time.

A binary search is used to locate the start index of the matching prefix.

The search then collects matching results in the range.

Optimized for:

Speed (O(log n))

Memory usage

Correct ordering (alphabetical display)

üîç This algorithm satisfies the constraint of sub-linear filtering time without introducing unnecessary memory overhead.

## üß™ Testing

* ViewModel and UseCase unit tests included
* Uses coroutine test utilities for predictable execution

---

## üé® UI / UX Design

* Based on the [provided prototype](https://mockitt.com/proto/xQ2D8Qi3suszki68EKdfSS/sharing?view_mode=read_)
* **City cell includes**:

  * Country flag
  * City and country code
  * Coordinates
* **Sticky headers**:

  * Display first letter group
  * Animate with scroll and maintain visual line
* **Search Bar**:

  * Animated transitions on focus/unfocus
  * Smooth UI state changes (loading, empty, results)
* **Performance**:

  * `LazyColumn` used for memory-efficient list rendering
  * `key` parameter optimizes recomposition using city ID

---

## üìà Optimization Techniques

* **Kotlin Collections**: Efficient filtering & transformation
* **Memory Optimization**:

  * Lazy loading with `LazyColumn`
  * No in-memory duplication
* **Performance Optimizations**:

  * State hoisting and minimal recompositions
  * Efficient keying of composables
* **Work in Progress**:

  * ProGuard configuration
  * Baseline profiler integration

  * JSON: Gson
  * DI: Hilt
  * Jetpack libraries only
